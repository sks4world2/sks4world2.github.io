    <h2>FOUNDER AND PURPOSE</h2>
    <h5>This website is a product of years of meditation on living with a purpose, aspiration to make a difference, giving the ladders to those who need, which I benefitted from so far. I'm taking some time on this page to explain my interests outside of my profession and the details of the projects I worked on, in my profession.</h5>
    <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src='srikrishna_headshot1.jpg' height='180px' width='140px'/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikrishna-krishnaraosrinivasan-a882b930/" target="_blank"><img src='linkedin.JPG' height="25px" width="25px"/></a></div>
    <p>My name is Srikrishna Krishnarao Srinivasan. The generous universe shaped me, coming in various forms. My family, school, teachers, universities, workplaces, bosses and a number of people. Each of them provided a ladder of some kind showing me a new world every time. There are many people out there who could use a ladder to see a new world. Therefore, through this website, I'm building a community to reach out and give the ladders who are in need of it. </p>

    <h2>OTHER THAN JOB</h2>
    <h5><strong>Running</strong> is one of my hobbies. It is not just a test of physical ability, but it is a great test of mental strength, perseverance and grit, especially in long distance runs.</h5>
    <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src='DubaiMarathon1.jpg' height='150px' width='180px' class='rotate90'/></div>
    <p>I love running. I took part in Dubai Marathon three times and ran 10kms each time. The best experience of running was on Oman Dibba mountains along with a team of three more office friends. It was a climb up the mountain in muddy road, each person from our team running a relay. Each of us  individually ran close to 17kms. As a team, we ran 68kms between 5am and 2pm, up and down the mountain.</p>
    <br>
    <h5><strong>Public speaking</strong> is both nerve-wracking and rewarding. The anxiety of having a message that audience can connect to and the reward of reaching out to hundreds in one go.</h5>
    <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;"><img src='FloridaBlueFinalist.jpg' height='180px' width='300'/></div>
    <p>I love public speaking. I recently made the following public speeches for a vibrant audience and highly experienced judges each time.
