			<p>
				Take an example. Let us say, you want to buy organic milk or butter or ghee. Though you pay a premium for organic products in your local supermarket, still you can't be fully sure about the quality - because, large corporations have an obligation to their shareholders to put profit before everything. On the otherhand, if you can find a reliable friend in your circle of friends who owns a farm, you can be more sure about buying from him/her. You can get opinions from your circle. You can visit the factory. Verify in many other ways. Moreover, this person will sell you at lower price. So, <strong> Better Quality... Lower Price.</strong>

			<h4 id="smallbusiness"><span class="highlighted">Small businesses in your interest</span></h4>
			<p>
				<img src="images/smallbusiness.jpg" style="height: 150px;"></br>
				For <strong>your economic security and that of your next generation,</strong> you should encourage small businesses and preserve them. Big businesses and small businesses are like two sides of a coin. If one of them go away, it causes economic damage to <strong>you</strong>. </br></br> Imagine all the food items are sold only by a few big businesses. God forbid, if they turn against people, root for bigger profits and pollute the food market, compromise on quality and involve in price fixing - what would you do? Small vendors preserve the supply chain and they bail you out. <strong>If small businesses are erased, you and your next generation become powerless against corporates.</strong>
